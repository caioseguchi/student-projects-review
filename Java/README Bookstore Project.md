# Bookstore Project

This project is based on one of my first code challenges, with the goal of practicing object-oriented programming and data manipulation. 

## Features
The application manages a collection of books, allowing users to perform various operations through a menu-driven interface. It meets the following requirements:

### Requirements
1. **Domain**:  
   The domain is represented by the `Book` object, which has multiple attributes that can be manipulated.

2. **Data Structure**:  
   All operations and data storage are handled using arrays.

3. **Menu Options**:  
   The application includes the following menu options:
   - Add a new book
   - View the list of books
   - Compare and display the book with the highest price
   - Compare and display the book with the lowest price
   - Calculate and display the average price of all books
   - Exit the application

4. **Object-Oriented Design**:  
   The project is structured using multiple classes to ensure clean and modular code.

## Project Structure
- **Domain**: The main domain object is the `Book` class, which encapsulates all book-related attributes and behaviors.
- **Data Handling**: An array is used to store and manage the collection of books.
- **Menu**: A menu system guides users through the application's features and ensures a user-friendly experience.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
